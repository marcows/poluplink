poluplink.pmb
  Logo for watch S120 (44x8 px) created by Polar UpLink Tool.

poluplink.wav
  Wave file corresponding to poluplink.pmb exported by Polar UpLink Tool. Due
  to a bug the logo in this .wav contains 47 instead of 44 columns. S120
  ignores the additional 3 columns, using a .wav with 44 columns works as
  well. The superfluous 3 columns may contain data from a previously exported
  47x8 px logo from S810 for example.

poluplink.txt
  Textual representation of poluplink.wav used as input for Poluplink.
